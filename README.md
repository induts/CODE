## Project description
The long-term response of the groundwater table level to irrigation and climate change is studied using a one-dimensional numerical model employing the ThornthwaiteMather procedure to calculate the root-zone water balance. The study focuses on rice cultivation at Avanigadda in the Krishna district of the state of Andhra Pradesh, India which experiences a monsoon climate. The effect of intensifying the cultivation is addressed by considering the cases of having one, two, and three crops per year with a single rainfed crop and the rest supported by groundwater irrigation. To address the effect of climate change, three well-known IPCC scenarios SRESA1B, SRESA2, and SRESB1 are simulated. Single crop agriculture is found to be sustainable irrespective of the climate scenario while two and three crop cultivations are found to be unsustainable with the water table level dropping to 200 - 1000 meters at the end of 21st century.
Matlab code and input files.
The mat lab code used to predict water table levels for an irrigated rain fed crop
(‗rainfed.m‘) is given below. The aquifer parameters are defined in the code itself.
Additional data required for running the model is precipitation and this is input as a
.mat file. The same code is used to predict water table levels in case of two crops a
year and three crops a year by changing the number of days irrigated. The process is
given in the flow chart shown in figure 21
