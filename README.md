# CODE
Matlab code and input files
The mat lab code used to predict water table levels for an irrigated rain fed crop
(‗rainfed.m‘) is given below. The aquifer parameters are defined in the code itself.
Additional data required for running the model is precipitation and this is input as a
.mat file. The same code is used to predict water table levels in case of two crops a
year and three crops a year by changing the number of days irrigated. The process is
given in the flow chart shown in figure 21
